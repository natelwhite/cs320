### Software Testing
- I can ensure that my software is functional and secure by using various testing techniques to verify the state of the software. Which technique is used varies depending on the software requirements and what the goal of the test is. Static testing should be used as early in the development cycle as possible to prevent defects/flaws from getting very far down the production pipeline. Black box testing can be used in these tests to verify functionality without knowing how the functionality is implemented. In more complex scenarios, it may be easier to use white box tests for unit/component testing since you can manipulate the internal state of a component in white box tests. Like before, it depends on project requirements and the goals of the test.
### User Needs and Approach to Software Development
- I can interpret user needs by first understanding the user's perspective which gives context for why the user has this need. After verifying that this need is within the scope of this application, then I can breakdown the needs of the user into achievable work products if needed before designing and implementing those work products. Part of this means having an iterative approach when designing software. Rather than defining a set of a features at the beginning of the project, designing them, implmementing them, and then testing them, each work product/feature should be designed, implemented, and tested in smaller cycles.
